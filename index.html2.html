<p>It'little airier—think angel food cake—with a dollop of whipped cream and fresh berries. <br>And when it comes to birthdays, some folks won't touch anything but a homemade cake, but there are a few of us who love a good old-fashioned grocery store cake, or even a cookie cake, with a missive scribbled in icing from a tube. <br>No matter your preferences, it's good to know the facts when it comes to different kinds of cake.</p>

<p>There are two main types of cake: butter (also known as a "shortened" cake) and foam.&nbsp; And then within each category there are many, many varieties. <br>The primary difference between the two cake types is the fat content. Shortened cakes have either butter, oil, or shortening in them. (A classic yellow cake is a perfect example.) Foam cakes have little to no fat and typically involve whipped eggs (either whites, yolks, or both), which make them lighter and airier.<br> Think rolled sponge cake, such as a Buche de Noel, which you might see during the holidays.</p>
